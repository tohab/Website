This week I am planning to employ a version of "digital minimalism". The goal of it is to redefine my relationship to technology, and to try to only use it in a way that serves my values. 

The true way to do this is to cut out all digital devices from one's life for a month (or so), and then very gradually add devices/technologies that is decided services a person's goals. For instance, if someone initially thought that Facebook makes them have a better social life, after going off it for a month they might realize that they are perfectly happe calling close friends by landline, and thus do not add it back into their life. Without taking that first leap, however, the person wouldn't realize that Facebook actually does a *disservice* to their life.

To me, this gets to the heart of our world's problematic relationship with technology -- *we* are used by our devices. It should be the other way around! By cutting out devices for a bit, we realize that people lived before the internet, before the iPhone. We realize the value of analog devices, the power of making real-life connections.

So anyways, my attempt at trying this is:

* Not use my smart-phone for a week
* Not use social media, namely Facebook
* Not use Google Calendar

Instead, I will use a "brick" phone and email to contact all
