### How I use this website

This is both a test at uploading to the website, and a record for me of some things I should, and shouldn't do on it.

1. Do work on the gh-pages branch of this git repository (Website). Only then will it be processed by Github into a website.
2. Do use "git add -a", "git commit -m 'a message'", then "git push origin gh-pages". If some changes have been made online, use "git pull", resolve conflicts, and try again.
3. Do use "bundle exec jekyll serve" to test out the website locally.
4. Do *not* use "jekyll build", which would build the files into a real website format. Github does that for me. If I do it as well, Github gets upset and the website goes down.
